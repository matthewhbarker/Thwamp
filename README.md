Title: Bass Synth Plugin Project

Overview
This project aims to develop a mono synthesizer plugin specifically designed for bass sounds. The plugin will feature various controls such as saturation, distortion, and a unique "kick" parameter to enhance the user's ability to create diverse and dynamic bass tones.

Team Members
[Your Name]: Project lead, responsible for overall design, coding, and documentation.
Technologies
JUCE: The plugin will be developed using the JUCE framework.
C++: The primary programming language used for development.
JUCE GUI Library: The graphical user interface library used for designing the plugin interface.
Features
Saturation Level: Controls the amount of saturation applied to the sound (0-100%).
Saturation Decay: Determines how the saturation fades over time (0-100%).
Distortion Level: Controls the level of distortion applied to the sound (0-100%).
Distortion Decay: Determines how the distortion fades over time (0-100%).
Kick Level: Controls the intensity of the "kick" effect added to the bass sound (0-100%).
Kick Time: Determines the position of the kick effect within the sample.
*Note: The implementation of individual envelopes for Saturation Decay and Distortion Decay will be considered during development.

Visualization
The plugin will feature a waveform monitor to display the generated waveform in real-time. As the user plays a note or adjusts the plugin's parameters, the waveform will update accordingly.

Milestones
Basic Milestones
Create a GitHub page describing the project, team members, technologies, and relevant resources.
Research and gather relevant resources (papers, websites, videos) related to bass synthesis and plugin development.
Expected Milestones
Develop a working prototype of the plugin with basic controls and functionality.
Implement the waveform monitor feature.
Add detailed instructions on how to run the plugin and what to expect.
Define project milestones for the remainder of the course:
Worst-case scenario:
Complete the working prototype with basic controls.
Implement the waveform monitor feature.
Expected:
Optimize the plugin's performance and usability.
Add presets and additional features to enhance the plugin's capabilities.
Stretch goals:
Implement individual envelopes for Saturation Decay and Distortion Decay, if feasible.
Create promotional materials and tutorials for the plugin.
Outline methods for testing and measuring the success of each milestone, such as user feedback, performance analysis, and comparison with other similar plugins.
Assign specific roles and responsibilities to each team member related to the project objectives.
